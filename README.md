# NEISS-Dash-Analysis

Under construction

An interactive dashboard to analyze data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.

The data for years 2003-2020 were not included because the repository would surpass the storage threshold if they were. 

I plan on making those years available at https://data.world/yzaya.

The data was obtained from: https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/NEISSQuery/
