# NEISS-Dash-Analysis

This is an analysis of the CPSC consumer product-related injury database called the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). The project utilizes SQL, Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The data for years 2003-2020 were not included here because the repository would surpass the storage threshold.

All data was obtained from: https://www.cpsc.gov/cgibin/NEISSQuery/
